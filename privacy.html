                    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>

                    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>Stoichiometry Calculator is designed with privacy in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or process any personal information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Your preferences and equation history are stored locally in your browser and never transmitted to our servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> The calculator works entirely in your browser without requiring registration or login.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
                    <p>Since we don't collect personal information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We cannot and do not track your usage patterns</li>
                        <li>We cannot and do not sell or share your data with third parties</li>
                        <li>We cannot and do not use your data for advertising purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Local Browser Storage</h3>
                    <p>The application may store the following data locally in your browser:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculation mode preferences (balance, redox, mass)</li>
                        <li>UI preferences and settings</li>
                        <li>Recent equation history (for your convenience)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This data remains on your device and can be cleared by clearing your browser's local storage.</p>
